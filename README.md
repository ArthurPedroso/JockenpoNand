# JockenpoNand - Complete Computer Project for PUCSP Course Activity

This GitHub repository houses a complete computer architecture developed within Logisim, serving as a project submission for an assignment within the Computer Organization course at PUCSP. Originally tasked with creating a simple circuit enabling a user to play Rock-Paper-Scissors (Joken Po), I opted to take on the challenge of constructing an entire computer based on the book "Nand To Tetris", further implementing the game's logic in assembly language.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** The primary goal of this project was to design and implement a fully functional computer system capable of executing assembly code, and program a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in assembly.

## About the Circuit in General

The goal of the circuit is to meet all specifications of Activity 2 through software (in this case, assembly) running within this circuit. While I recognize various areas within the circuit that could be improved in terms of complexity (reducing chips and sub-circuits), my primary objective with the project is to implement a functional version of the circuit that meets the Activity 2 specifications in the shortest possible time.

The implementation of this computer was carried out following the projects outlined in the book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles". I aimed to stay as faithful as possible to the vertical implementation that starts solely from a NAND logic gate.

Overall, all circuits and sub-circuits used in the project are constructed from other sub-circuits that I implemented, and at the core of all these implementations lies the NAND logic gate. While this implementation philosophy was possible for the majority of the circuit, due to the limitations of Logisim—specifically, it freezes with RAM implementations exceeding 64 registers—I had to utilize Logisim's standard RAM and ROM memory chips.

## About NTT_BasicGates.circ

This Logisim library contains basic logic gates used throughout the project. Their implementation was solely achieved using other logic gates or the NAND logic gate.

## About NTT_ALU.circ

This library contains the implementation of chips that perform arithmetic logic, with the central piece being the ALU. For some peculiar reason unknown to me, Logisim randomly loads the ALU chip with errors, and during program execution, red errors start appearing from the ALU. However, by deleting and adding the ALU back to the circuit, the errors disappear. It's worth noting that the ALU chip does not have any sequential system dependent on previous states, so I find it plausible that the error might be a Logisim bug.

## About NTT_Memory.circ

This library implements memory chips that will be used in the final computer chip. During the implementation of these chips, it became evident that Logisim was not intended to simulate memory chips with a high number of components. As a result, I decided to implement only the RAM8 and RAM64 chips to at least demonstrate how I would have implemented the rest of the chips. After all, the implementation logic for chips with more memory would remain the same, with demultiplexers and multiplexers controlling memory address access. For the largest memory chip, the RAM16K chip, I simply encapsulated a standard RAM chip from Logisim.

## About NTT_FullComputer.circ

This is the main file of the project divided into two parts: The first contains the chips "FullMemory", "CPU", and "HackPC", which are the implementation of the Chapter Five project from the book where the final computer is assembled. The second part contains the chips "DebugHackPC" and "HackPCJockenpo", which are the chips used to meet the requirements of Activity 2. Specifically, "DebugHackPC" was created due to the necessity to visualize memory access and write operations for debugging the program, while "HackPCJockenpo" encapsulates the "DebugHackPC" circuit for easy visualization and program testing.

## Software Development

Since the developed computer meets all the book's project requirements, it's possible to use the machine code generated by the assembler provided on the book's website. Luckily, the ".circ" files saved by Logisim are actually XML files, so editing and adding code to the computer's ROM was straightforward. All assembly code used in the project is located at the end of the pdf file in this repository.

## How to Test the Program

To test the program, modify the 8 bits of input within the "DebugHackPC" or "DebugHackPC" file, which are facing downwards in the circuit. Their functionality is described below from right to left. Also described below are the output bits, which are also described from right to left.

### Input Bits
- Bit 1: J1Rock
- Bit 2: J1Scissors
- Bit 3: J1Paper
- Bit 4: J2Rock
- Bit 5: J2Scissors
- Bit 6: J2Paper
- Bit 7: Play
- Bit 8: Reset
### Output Bits
- Bit 1: ScoreJ1
- Bit 2: ScoreJ1
- Bit 3: ScoreJ2
- Bit 4: ScoreJ2
- Bit 5: WinnerJ1
- Bit 6: WinnerJ2
- Bit 7: Error
- Bit 8: Processing

Obs 1: Output bit 8 "Processing" lights up if the computer is processing instructions sent by the input and turns off when the system is ready to receive the next input. Based on this bit, it's possible to identify if the play was a tie.

Obs 2: Input bit 7 "Play" needs to be turned off and on again to compute the play. This prevents unwanted plays from occurring.

Obs 3: There is a "ResetCPU" bit that resets the program's program counter. If activated, it resets the program to the beginning without altering the registers of the RAM memory. Generally, it should not be used.
